Project: NLP Model for Text Classification and Deployment with Full MLOps Pipeline
Overview

Build an NLP model that classifies customer support queries into categories (e.g., Billing, Technical Support, Account Issues). You'll go through all stages of the ML lifecycle: data gathering, model training, versioning, deployment, and monitoring in a cloud environment.
Steps and Tools
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

    Task: Collect a dataset of customer support queries (you can use publicly available datasets or simulate your own).
        Example dataset: Kaggle Customer Support on Twitter.
    Tools:
        Python/pandas: For preprocessing (tokenizing, cleaning, etc.).
        Jupyter Notebooks: Document and visualize your data cleaning and exploration.
        Git/GitHub: Track all changes to your data cleaning and preprocessing scripts.

2. Model Training

    Task: Train an NLP model to classify text queries.
        Start with a Transformer-based model (e.g., BERT or DistilBERT) using the Hugging Face transformers library.
    Tools:
        Hugging Face Transformers: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model.
        MLflow/Weights & Biases (W&B): Use one of these tools to track experiments, hyperparameters, and model performance.
        Docker: Create a Docker container for your training environment.
        DVC: Use DVC to version your dataset and track the different model versions during experimentation.

3. Model Optimization

    Task: Use techniques like hyperparameter tuning, model quantization, or pruning to optimize your model.
    Tools:
        Hyperparameter tuning: You can use Optuna or Ray Tune to automate hyperparameter tuning.
        TensorRT (if applicable): If you're using NVIDIA GPUs, optimize the model for inference using TensorRT.

4. Containerization with Docker

    Task: Package the trained model and the inference code inside a Docker container.
    Tools:
        Docker: Write a Dockerfile that includes your inference code and installs all necessary dependencies (Hugging Face, Flask/FastAPI).
        nvidia-docker: If using GPU for inference, package it in a container that leverages GPU.

5. API Development

    Task: Develop an API endpoint that serves predictions from your model.
    Tools:
        FastAPI or Flask: Build a RESTful API to accept new customer support queries and return the predicted category.
        Postman: For testing your API locally before deployment.

6. Cloud Deployment

    Task: Deploy the model and API to a cloud platform.
    Tools:
        AWS/GCP/Azure: Set up a cloud environment (e.g., EC2 or Lambda on AWS). For real-time inference, an EC2 instance with GPU could work well.
        AWS SageMaker: Alternatively, deploy the model on AWS SageMaker for real-time prediction serving.
        Terraform: Use Terraform to provision cloud resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.
        CI/CD with Jenkins or GitLab CI: Automate the deployment pipeline. Trigger a new deployment whenever you push a new version of your code/model to GitHub.

7. Model Monitoring and Logging

    Task: Monitor the model in production for performance and errors.
    Tools:
        Prometheus & Grafana: Monitor your API's performance (e.g., response times, errors).
        ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Set up logging for your API and model, and visualize any issues that arise.
        MLflow: Track model performance metrics over time and monitor drift.

8. Model Retraining and Data Versioning

    Task: Implement an automated model retraining system that periodically retrains your model with new data.
    Tools:
        Apache Airflow: Set up a workflow that collects new customer queries, adds them to your training dataset, and retrains the model every week or month.
        DVC: Track new versions of your dataset and model.

9. Testing and Security

    Task: Ensure your deployment is secure and properly tested.
    Tools:
        Unit and integration testing: Write tests for your model's inference logic and API using pytest.
        Security: Implement API security (e.g., using API tokens or OAuth).

10. Final Touches and Documentation

    Task: Document your project from start to finish.
    Tools:
        GitHub Pages or Jupyter Book: Create detailed documentation of your pipeline, decisions made, and results.
        Jenkins or GitHub Actions: Automate documentation builds as part of your CI pipeline.
